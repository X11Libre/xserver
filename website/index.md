XLibre Xserver
==============

Xlibre is a fork of the [Xorg Xserver](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver) with lots of code cleanups and enhanced functionality.

This fork was necessary since toxic elements within Xorg projects, moles
from BigTech, are boycotting any substantial work on Xorg, in order to
destroy the project, to eliminate competition of their own products.
Classic "embrace, extend, extinguish" tactics.

Right after journalists first began covering the planned fork Xlibre,
on June 6th 2025, Redhat employees started a purge on the Xlibre founder's
GitLab account on freedesktop.org: deleted the git repo, tickets, merge
requests, etc, and so fired the shot that the whole world heard.

This is an independent project, not at all affiliated with BigTech or any
of their subsidiaries or tax evasion tools, nor any political activists
groups, state actors, etc. It's explicitly free of any "DEI" or similar
discriminatory policies. Anybody who's treating others nicely is welcomed.

It doesn't matter which country you're coming from, your political views, your
race, your sex, your age, your food menu, whether you wear boots or heels,
whether you're furry or fairy, Conan or McKay, comic character, a small furry
creature from Alpha Centauri, or literally everyone else. Even neurodivergent
contributors are welcome and accepted.

Anybody who's interested in bringing X forward is welcome. 

Together we'll make X great again!
