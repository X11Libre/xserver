**A:** Xlibre is a freshly created fork of the Xorg X11 server, initiated by Enrico Weigelt, aiming to provide a more actively maintained and modernized alternative to the aging X11 system.

**Q:** Why was it forked?

**A:** Xorg has been stifled by “toxic elements” and “BigTech moles” blocking significant contributions. A classic “embrace, extend, extinguish” pattern. Xlibre is presented as a pushback to revitalize the codebase.

**A:** The fork is led by Enrico Weigelt ([@metux](https://github.com/metux)), previously a prolific contributor to Xorg.

**Q:** What features or enhancements does Xlibre bring?
