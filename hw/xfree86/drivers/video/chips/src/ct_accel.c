 * When monochrome tiles/stipples are cached on the HiQV chipsets the
 * pitch of the monochrome data is the displayWidth. The HiQV manuals
 * state that the source pitch is ignored with monochrome data, and so
 * "officially" there the XAA cached monochrome data can't be used. But
 * it appears that by not setting the monochrome source alignment in
 * BR03, the monochrome source pitch is forced to the displayWidth!!
